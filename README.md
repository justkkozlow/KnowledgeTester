<h3>In this project &#9994;</h3>
<p>Of course this project for first looks easy, but I`m a few beginners in Python programming so not judge me harshly.<p>   
<p>This project is just a test of knowledge from any field.<br> 
For edit questions list your need to correct file <u>[questions.py]</u> who is in <u>[module]</u> directory and represents a dictionary python.</p>
