<h3>About &#129488;:</h3>
My first task on time basical Python &#128013; programming cource is KnowledgeTest App.<br>
I chose this project because in another training I had to memorize 72 questions and their answers.<br>
Since the questions were given to me on a paper brochure, and the answers to them had to be searched in Google or in some books (paper or pdf), the school created a web test for students, but access to this service is paid.<br>
Some probably understood what courses I wrote about above &#129327;.

<h3>The task had the following requirements:</h3>

1. Minimum 10 questions from any field of knowledge.
2. Possibility to choose option an answer and score.
3. GUI or console.
4. Separate module or modules, engaged processing user input user interaction.
5. Separate core module who stores test classes and computing logic.
6. [Optoion] module for interaction between kernel and interface.


<h3>In this project &#128161;:</h3>

Of course this project for first looks easy, but I`m a few beginners in Python &#128013; programming so not judge me harshly.   
This project is just a test of knowledge from any field.<br> 
For edit questions list your need to correct file ***[questions.py]*** who is in ***[module]*** directory and represents a dictionary Python &#128013;.
